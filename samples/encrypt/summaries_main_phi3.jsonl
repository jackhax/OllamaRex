{"main": "This C function reads a file, encrypts its contents by performing XOR and bit rotation operations on each byte using random values as keys, writes the encrypted data to another file along with the encryption seed (current time), modifies an offset value in memory without returning it. The core operation can be summarized as \"File Encryption With Memory Modification\"."}
